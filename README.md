# Introduction

Lopsided galaxies are late-type galaxies that feature a non-axisymmetric disk. This asymmetry can significantly impact the dynamical structure and evolution of the host galaxy, causing enhanced star-forming regions, fueling the central active galactic nucleus, and redistributing matter, among others. Furthermore, several works have found differences in the structural properties of lopsided galaxies with respect to the ones of more symmetrical late-type galaxies, such as the central stellar mass density, gravitation cohesiveness, and star formation history.



In this project we aim to study lopsided galaxies using only their internal propierties, without any information about the environment they reside.
